# Front End
This is a simple front end made to interact with the API created in [spaceship-titanic](https://github.com/lorcanrae/spaceship-titanic).  
The front end accesses the spaceship-titanic api deployed on GCP Cloud Run to see if you would have survived the collision with the spacetime anomaly based on your inputs!

Deployed on streamlit.
